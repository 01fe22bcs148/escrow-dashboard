## 🧠 How It Works

1) Users log in using an email address.

2) Stock prices are simulated on the server and updated every second.

3) Users can subscribe or unsubscribe from stocks.

4) Subscribed stock prices update live using WebSockets.

5) Multiple users can log in from different browsers and receive independent updates.

## ⚠️ Note
This application uses **simulated stock prices** generated using a random number algorithm for demonstration purposes only. The data does not represent real market prices.

2) Frontend–backend communication

3) Handling asynchronous data streams

4) Production deployment with Vercel

5) Debugging CRA production build issues

The system enables users to subscribe to stocks and view live price updates without refreshing the interface. By integrating frontend and backend components and deploying the application in a production environment, the project provides practical exposure to real-world web application development.
